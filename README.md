# VA'A WORKOUTS REST API AND CRUD

## Objective

This API was developed during the NodeJS training program at ModalGR. Its main objectives were to meet the requirements of Challenge 03, which include:

- Utilizing NestJS, TypeScript, Sequelize, and PostgreSQL.
- 100% English project.
- Password encryption when saving to the database.
- Authentication for certain routes.
- Full CRUD functionality.
- Integration with a frontend.
- Accessible through the web.

## Problem

In addition to my passion for technology, I am also an avid paddler. However, despite tracking my workouts on my watch, my team and I struggled to maintain effective control over our training progress.

To address this issue, I decided to develop this project, which includes a login and password system. Only registered users can add workouts, making it easier to monitor the team's progress.

## Technologies Used

- NestJS
- TypeScript
- Sequelize
- PostgreSQL
- Swagger
- bcrypt
- JWT
- React
- Axios

## Improvements and Areas for Growth

As I had limited time to complete the project and had minimal frontend experience, I identified several areas for improvement, despite being satisfied with the results:

- SQL, database modeling, relationships, and related topics.
- Creating more complex routes.
- Handling API errors and responses.
- Enhancing backend and frontend integration. I learned valuable lessons during this project, which will be applied in future projects.
- Frontend, particularly CSS.
